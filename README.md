# Example Dags

This repository contains example DAGs that can be used "out-of-the-box" using
operators found in the Airflow Plugins organization. These DAGs have a range
of use cases and vary from moving data (see [ETL](https://github.com/airflow-plugins/example_dags/tree/master/etl))
to background system automation that can give your Airflow "super-powers".

## Getting Started 
Coming soon...

## Contributions
Contributions of your own DAGs are very welcome. Please see some of the example
DAGs for a sense of general formatting guidelines.
